# RoundButton

This project accompanies the tutorial on my blog here: http://www.iosinsight.com/swift-round-uibutton-subclass-ibdesignable/

Illustrates an easy subclass of UIButton for rendering round buttons.
The implementation uses IBDesignable and IBInspectable so that the button can be fully configured in Interface Builder,
without resorting to programmatic configuration.
